The goal of this lab is to effectively visualize numerical and categorical data.

For all visualizations you create, be sure to include informative titles for the plot, axes, and legend!

# Getting started

1.  Use [these steps](https://sta101-f24.github.io/computing/computing-access.html) to navigate to `RStudio` using the [Duke Container Manager](https://cmgr.oit.duke.edu/containers);

2.  Use [these steps](https://sta101-f24.github.io/computing/computing-moving.html) to download the blank template `lab-2.qmd` and the data set `courage.csv` from our [Canvas page](https://canvas.duke.edu/courses/36641), upload them to your `RStudio` files, and move them into an appropriately named folder (`lab-2`, for instance);

3.  Once `lab-2.qmd` is where it needs to be, open it, and verify that you can click the "Render" button in `RStudio` and get a PDF file. See [this answer](https://edstem.org/us/courses/64268/discussion/5216372?answer=12080244) on Ed if you want more guidance here;

4.  Now proceed to complete the exercises in this lab.

# Packages

In this lab we will work with the tidyverse packages, which is a collection of packages for doing data analysis in a "tidy" way.

# Part 1: NC Courage

Today, we will be working with data from the first three full seasons of the NC Courage, a highly successful National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) team located near Duke in Cary, NC. The Courage moved to the Triangle from Western New York in 2017 and had three epic seasons in NC, culminating in winning the championship game that was held at their stadium in Cary in 2019! Data for this lab was sourced from the [`nwslR` package on Github](https://github.com/adror1/nwslR), and verified with the NC Courage website by Meredith Brown (Duke StatSci '21) in a previous semester.

```{r}
#| message: false

courage <- read_csv("data/courage.csv")
```

Recalling the information [here](https://sta101-f24.github.io/computing/computing-file-paths.html), be prepared to adjust the file path to match how you have organized your files and folders.
:::

The `courage` dataset has `r nrow(courage)` rows and `r ncol(courage)` variables. The variables in the dataset are as follows:

| Variable      | Descripton                                         |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `game_id`     | An unique ID for the game                          |
| `game_date`   | Game date                                          |
| `game_number` | Game number                                        |
| `home_team`   | Name of the home team, abbreviated                 |
| `away_team`   | Name of the away team, abbreviated                 |
| `opponent`    | The team NC Courage played against                 |
| `home_pts`    | Number of points by the home team                  |
| `away_pts`    | Number of points by the away team                  |
| `result`      | Result of the game for NC Courage (win, loss, tie) |
| `season`      | Season (2017, 2018, or 2019)                       |

## Exercise 1

::: exercise
Create a bar plot of the `result`s of games for NC Courage. Additionally, calculate the numbers of wins, losses, and ties. Write a one sentence narrative for your findings.
:::

**Hint:** `result` is a categorical variable, so use a bar plot for the visualization and the `count()` function for calculating the frequencies of *levels* of this variable.

## Exercise 2

::: exercise
Create a new variable indicating whether the game was played at home or away for NC Courage. This variable should be called `home_courage` and take the value "home" if NC Courage is the home team and "away" if NC Courage is the away team. (Instructions for how to do this are given below.)

Then, calculate the number of home and away games, and write a one sentence narrative for your findings.
:::

Use the example code below to get started.

```{r}
courage <- courage |>
  mutate(home_courage = if_else(home_team == "NC", "home", "away"))
```

There are two things of note here:

-   The use of the assignment operator (`<-`) to assign the resulting data frame to `courage`, thus overwriting the `courage` dataset to contain this new column. We do this because we will use this new variable, `home_courage`, in a subsequent exercise.

-   The use of a new function, `if_else()` to determine whether the game is played at home or away.

    -   `home_team == "NC"` finds all rows where the home team is NC Courage.
    -   If the home team is NC Courage, then we set the value of `home_courage` to \`"home".
    -   Otherwise (else) Courage must be the away team and we set the value of `home_courage` to `"away"`.

## Exercise 3

::: exercise
a.  this code creates a visualization that displays the relationship between `home_courage` and `result`:

```{r}
ggplot(courage, aes(x = home_courage, fill = result)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill")
```

Explain what each piece of the code is doing. Why does it produce the plot that it produces?
:::

::: exercise
b.  Calculate the proportions of home and away games that the Courage won. Based on these, do your findings suggest a home-field advantage? Why or why not?
:::

So far we have focused on whether the game was at home or away and whether the Courage won. Next, we dive deeper and focus on the number of points the Courage wins by, at home and away.

## Exercise 4

::: exercise
How many points do the Courage typically win by (on average)? Use the example code below to get started. You'll encounter a new function: `abs()` is the absolute value function. It takes the absolute value of a number. Why do we want to use this absolute value function here?
:::

**Hint:** We are only interested in games the Courage wins, therefore we should `filter()` for those games first.

```{r}
#| eval: false

courage |>
  filter(___) |>
  mutate(win_pts = abs(home_pts - away_pts)) |>
  summarize(___)
```

## Exercise 5

::: exercise
How many points do NC Courage score when they win (on average)? Note this is **different than how many points** they "win by". How many points do the Courage score when they lose on average?
:::

To calculate this we first need to determine how many points NC Courage scored in every game. We can use `if_else()` logic again to find this value for each game, and store it in a new column, `courage_pts`.

```{r}
#| eval: false

courage <- courage |>
  mutate(courage_pts = if_else(home_team == "NC", home_pts, away_pts))

courage |>
  group_by(___) |>
  summarize(___)
```

## Exercise 6

::: exercise
Next we'll investigate visually whether or not NC Courage has a home-field advantage. To start, let's build on the courage2 data frame. Add a new column called home_courage that takes the value "home" if Courage is the home team and "away" if Courage is the away team. Hint: use the ifelse logic from exercise 4.

Mutate the `courage` data frame to create two new variables:

-   `total_pts`: Sum of points scored by both teams, i.e. `home_pts + away_pts`.

-   `opponent_pts`: Points scored by the opposing team, i.e., `total_pts - courage_pts`.

Save the resulting data frame as `courage` again and print the three points columns (`total_pts`, `opponent_pts`, `courage_pts`) to screen.
:::

**Hint:**

-   Use the `mutate()` function to create the columns.

```{r}
#| eval: false

courage <- courage |>
  mutate(
    total_pts = ___,
    opponent_pts = ___
    )
```

-   Use the `select()` function to print them to screen:

```{r}
#| eval: false

courage |>
  select(total_pts, opponent_pts, courage_pts)
```

## Exercise 7

::: exercise
Create a scatter plot:

-   `opponent_pts` (y) vs. `courage_pts` (x)

-   Color the scatter plot by whether NC Courage are home or away.

-   Represent the data with "jittered" points wth `geom_jitter()`.

-   Overlay a $y = x$ line with `geom_abline()`.

-   Faceted by season.

What does the line represent? What does it mean for a point to fall above the line? Below the line?
:::

```{r}
#| eval: false

ggplot(courage, aes(x = ___, y = ___, color = ___)) + 
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0.1) + 
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0) +
  facet_wrap(~ ___) +
  labs(
    x = "___", 
    y = "___", 
    title = "___", 
    color = "___"
  )
```

## Exercise 8

::: exercise
If we want to formally test whether the Courage have a home-field advantage, then we must first define what this means! In your own words, what do you think a home-field advantage means? Then, now that you've defined what it means to have a home field advantage, define what it means to **not** have a home-field advantage.
