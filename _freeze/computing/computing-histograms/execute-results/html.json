It shows you where the data values are typically concentrated, how spread out they are, and whether or not there are any asymmetries.\n\nThis primer leads you down the path of least resistance to producing a histogram plot using `R`. Trust me; you would not want to do this by hand.\n\n## Loading a package\n\nThe command for plotting a histogram is contained inside the `tidyverse` package, so you need to load that first:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse) \n```\n:::\n\n\n## Loading a dataset\n\nNext, we need something to plot, so let us load in a data set. We will consider the flint water data that was mentioned during the second lecture on 8/29/2024:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nflint <- read_csv(\"flint.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nLet us unpack what this is doing:\n\n-   `read_csv` is a *function*, just like $f(x)=x^2$ or $f(x)=ax+b$ from your math class. It receives an input, and returns an output. The input is the name of a file: `\"flint.csv\"`. The output is a data frame (a spreadsheet) in `R`;\n-   When you run `read_csv`, it returns a data frame. But if you don't give that data frame a name and store it someplace, then you can't actually use it. So that's what the `flint <-` part is doing. You are *assigning* the output of `read_csv` to a variable named \"flint.\" If this went as planned, you should see `flint` listed in the upper right Environment tab of `RStudio`:\\\n    \\\n    ![](data_in_environment.png){width=\"347\"}\n\n::: callout-note\nRecalling the information [here](https://sta101-f24.github.io/computing/computing-file-paths.html), you may have to modify the file path to something like `\"~/lecture-2/flint.csv\"` to match the particular way you have chosen to name and organize your files and folders.\n:::\n\n## Plotting a histogram\n\nHere is the basic command in all its glory:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(flint, aes(x = lead)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 250) + \n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 100))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](computing-histograms_files/figure-html/histogram-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow let's talk about it:\n\n-   `ggplot(flint, aes(x = lead))` is where we tell `R` what data frame we are using (`flint`) and which variable (column) in that data set we want to plot (`lead`);\n-   Next, we use `geom_histogram(bins = 250)` to tell it that we specifically want a histogram with 250 bins;\n-   Last, we use `coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 100))` to adjust the bounds of the horizontal axis: start at x = 0 and end at x = 100;\n-   We stitch all of these requests together using the `+` sign, and to make things more readable (not run off the page), we put a new line after each `+`.\n\n## Adding a vertical line to the histogram\n\nWhen plotting a histogram, it can also be useful to indicate on the plot the location of some particularly meaningful summary statistics, such as the mean or median. In order to do this, we can use the same basic command from the previous section, but then add some extra *layers* that will place vertical lines on the plot at those values:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean_value <- mean(flint$lead)\nmedian_value <- median(flint$lead)\n\nggplot(flint, aes(x = lead)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 250) + \n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 100)) + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = mean_value, color = \"red\") + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = median_value, color = \"blue\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](computing-histograms_files/figure-html/histogram-with-line-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNotice that the distribution of lead levels is positively skewed, which results in the mean being larger than the median.\n\n## Now you try\n\nTo double check that you can follow these instructions, redo everything above using a different data set. This may require you to modify the code in various ways:\n\n-   the file path you provide to `read_csv`;\n-   the name you assign to the resulting data frame;\n-   the variable you plot in `aes(x = lead)`;\n-   the number of histogram bins;\n-   the range of the horizontal axis.\n\nCheck that you are comfortable making these changes.\n",
