Each bar in the chart is counting the number of observations (rows) that correspond to each level of the categorical variable.\n\n## Load a data set\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\nLet's load the data from the 2020 Durham City and County Resident Survey (originally in the Canvas lecture 4 folder), where each row is a Durham resident:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndurham <- read_csv(\"durham-2020.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-note\nRecalling the information [here](https://sta101-f24.github.io/computing/computing-file-paths.html), be prepared to adjust the file path to match how you have organized your files and folders.\n:::\n\nOne of the columns in this data set is a categorical variable called `would_you_say_your_total_annual_hous_35`, with four levels corresponding to the resident's income:\n\n1.  Under \\$30,000;\n2.  \\$30,000-\\$59,999\n3.  \\$60,000-\\$99,999\n4.  \\$100,000 or more\n\nFurthermore, some folks left this part of the survey blank, and so their income information is missing, which effectively creates a fifth category. Before plotting, let us quickly modify the data to give this income variable a more concise name, as well as making it a proper `factor` type in `R`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndurham <- durham |>\n  rename(income = would_you_say_your_total_annual_hous_35) |>\n  mutate(income = as_factor(income))\n```\n:::\n\n\n## The basic plot\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(durham, aes(x = income)) +\n  geom_bar()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](computing-barplot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe basic template here is very similar to what we saw for the [histogram](https://sta101-f24.github.io/computing/computing-histograms.html). The first layer uses `ggplot` to indicate what data you wish to plot. Then the next layer uses `geom_bar` to specifically make it a bar plot.\n\nIn the first layer we used `x =` inside `aes` to make the bars vertical, but we could have made them horizontal as well:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(durham, aes(y = income)) +\n  geom_bar()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](computing-barplot_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nDo you see what changed?\n\n## Adding layers to prettify it\n\nWe could call it a day at this point, but the basic plot is rather drab. Here is some code that would zhuzh it up in a big way:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndurham |>\n  ggplot(aes(y = income, fill = income)) +\n  geom_bar(show.legend = FALSE) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Count\",\n    y = NULL,\n    title = \"Would you say your total annual household income is...\"\n  ) + \n  scale_y_discrete(\n    labels = c(\n      \"1\" = \"Under $30,000\",\n      \"2\" = \"$30,000-$59,999\",\n      \"3\" = \"$60,000-$99,999\",\n      \"4\" = \"$100,000 or more\"\n    )\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](computing-barplot_files/figure-html/income-improve-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   The first `ggplot` layer tells it what data to use. We also added the `fill =` argument inside `aes` to apply a default color scheme;\n-   the `labs` layer allows us to add a title and label the axes;\n-   the `scale_y_discrete` layer allows us to replace the bar labels 1, 2, 3, 4 with more informative text that explains what the levels of the variable actually mean;\n-   in between every layer, we have a `+`. Gotta have that icing!\n",
