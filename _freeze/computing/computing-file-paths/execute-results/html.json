A command like this may not work:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nflint <- read_csv(\"flint.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhy not? Because the file `flint.csv` is inside one of your handy dandy folders, but you have not told `read_csv` *which* folder, and so it cannot find it. To fix this, change the code to this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nflint <- read_csv(\"~/lecture-2/flint.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe string `\"~/lecture-2/flint.csv\"` is called a **file path** and it tells the function `read_csv` the path of folders it has to search down in order to find the file `flint.csv`. If you have chosen to give your folders slightly different names like `Lecture 2` or `Lecture-2` or `lecture 2` or `john-sucks`, that's fine. Just make sure you make the appropriate change when you run the command. So `flint <- read_csv(\"~/Lecture 2/flint.csv\")` or `flint <- read_csv(\"~/john-sucks/flint.csv\")` , etc.\n",
