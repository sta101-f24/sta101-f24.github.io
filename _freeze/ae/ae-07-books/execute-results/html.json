The dataset has 15 observations and 4 columns. Each observation represents a book. Note that `volume` is measured in cubic centimeters and `weight` is measured in grams. More information on the dataset can be found in the documentation for `allbacks`, with `?allbacks`.\n\n# Single predictor\n\n## Plot the best fit line\n\nVisualize the relationship between volume (on the x-axis) and weight (on the y-axis). Overlay the line of best fit. Describe the relationship between these variables.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(allbacks, aes(x = volume, y = weight)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Volume (cubic centimeters)\",\n    y = \"Weight (grams)\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ae-07-books_files/figure-html/plot-weight-volume-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n> Add response here.\n\n## Get the estimated regression coefficients\n\nFit a model predicting weight from volume for these books and save it as `weight_fit`.

Use different colors and shapes for hardback and paperback books. Also use different colors for lines of best fit for the two types of books. In addition, add the overall line of best fit (from Exercise 1) as a gray dashed line so that you can see the difference between the lines when considering and not considering cover type.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(allbacks, aes(x = volume, y = weight)) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, color = \"gray\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Volume (cubic centimeters)\",\n    y = \"Weight (grams)\",\n    shape = \"Cover\", color = \"Cover\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ae-07-books_files/figure-html/plot-weight-volume-cover-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Get the estimated regression coefficients\n\nFit a model predicting weight from volume for these books and save it as `weight_cover_fit`.
