## Collaboration

- You are encouraged to discuss and help one another with the labs, but you should not share solutions (e.g. emailing a friend your code). All submitted work must be your own;
- You are forbidden from collaborating in any way on the exams;
- You are enthusiastically encouraged to collaborate with your teammates on all aspects of the final project.

## Communication

## Late work and extensions

No late work will be accepted unless you request an extension in advanced. All reasonable requests will be entertained, but extensions will not be long.

## Regrade requests

You have one week after receiving a grade to dispute it. Regrade requests can be made in Gradescope, and the instructor will do the regrading.
