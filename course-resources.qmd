## Academic support

There are times you may need help with the class that is beyond what can be provided by the teaching team.
In those instances, I encourage you to visit the Academic Resource Center.
The [Academic Resource Center (ARC)](https://arc.duke.edu) offers free services to all students during their undergraduate careers at Duke.
Services include Learning Consultations, Peer Tutoring and Study Groups, ADHD/LD Coaching, Outreach Workshops, and more.
Because learning is a process unique to every individual, they work with each student to discover and develop their own academic strategy for success at Duke.
Contact the ARC to schedule an appointment.
Undergraduates in any year, studying any discipline can benefit!
Contact [ARC\@duke.edu](mailto:arc@duke.edu), 919-684-5917.
